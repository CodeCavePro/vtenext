# WHY WE DO THAT?

Too many companies are spending a lot of money in solutions that are not able to fix the real customer relationship problems. That solutions aren’ t able to be used from the organizations: too complicated, too dashboards, too procedures to know. The outcome is people that after the start up period, give up the application and come back to work in the old style: mail and spreadsheets.
This is a defeat not of the organizations but of the CRM applications that are not able to find the core of the problem.

We want to do their job easily and make CRM projects more effective, so was born VTE NEXT.
